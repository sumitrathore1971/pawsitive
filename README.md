## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
-   **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher (recommended).
-   **npm**: Node Package Manager (comes with Node.js).
-   **MongoDB**: An instance of MongoDB (local or cloud-hosted).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sumitrathore1971/bhu-nirakshak.git
    cd bhu-nirakshak
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd client1
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Environment setup**
    Create `.env` files in both `backend/` and `client1/` directories:
    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    cp client1/.env.example client1/.env # If applicable, .env.example not detected for client1
    ```
    Configure your environment variables in `backend/.env` and `client1/.env`:

    **`backend/.env` (Example - specific variables may vary based on implementation):**
    | Variable      | Description                                       | Default     | Required |
    |---------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
    | `PORT`        | Port for the backend server                       | `5000`      | No       |
    | `MONGO_URI`   | Connection string for your MongoDB database       | -           | Yes      |
    | `JWT_SECRET`  | Secret key for JSON Web Token authentication      | -           | Yes      |
    | `NODE_ENV`    | Node.js environment (`development` or `production`)| `development`| No       |

    **`client1/.env` (Example - specific variables may vary based on implementation):**
    | Variable           | Description                               | Default     | Required |
    |--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
    | `REACT_APP_API_URL`| URL of the backend API                     | `http://localhost:5000/api` | Yes      |
    | `PORT`             | Port for the frontend development server   | `3000`      | No       |

5.  **Database setup** (if applicable)
    Ensure your MongoDB instance is running.
    No explicit migration commands were detected at the top level, typically for MERN stack, data models are defined and created on first insert or through an ORM.

6.  **Start development servers**
    The project includes a `start-dev.bat` script for Windows users to launch both frontend and backend concurrently.

    **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    start-dev.bat
    ```

    **On Linux/macOS (manual start):**
    Open two separate terminal windows.

    *   **Terminal 1 (for Backend):**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        npm start
        ```
        The backend API will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

    *   **Terminal 2 (for Frontend):**
        ```bash
        cd client1
        npm start
        ```
        The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.

7.  **Open your browser**
    Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Environment variables are used to configure database connections, API keys, and other sensitive information. Refer to the `.env.example` files in `backend/` and `client1/` for a comprehensive list.

### Configuration Files
-   `render.yaml`: Defines the services and settings for deploying the application on Render.com.

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
The `package.json` files within `backend/` and `client1/` contain various scripts for development, building, and testing.

| Command             | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `npm start` (backend) | Starts the backend API server in development mode |
| `npm start` (client1) | Starts the frontend development server           |
| `npm run build` (client1) | Creates a production-ready build of the frontend |

### Development Workflow
For local development, use the `start-dev.bat` script on Windows or manually start the backend and frontend servers as described in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

## 🧪 Testing

Testing configurations and scripts were not explicitly detected in the top-level repository structure. If tests are available, they would typically be run using:

```bash
# Example: Run backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Example: Run frontend tests
cd client1
npm test
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This project includes a `render.yaml` file, indicating a streamlined deployment process to [Render.com](https://render.com).

### Production Build
To create a production-ready build of the frontend application:
```bash
cd client1
npm run build
```
This will generate optimized static assets in the `client1/build` (or `client1/dist`) directory.

### Deployment Options
-   **Render.com**: The `render.yaml` file specifies configurations for deploying both the backend and frontend services on Render. You can connect your GitHub repository to Render, and it will automatically deploy based on this configuration.
    *   **Backend Service:** Deploys the `backend` directory as a Node.js web service.
    *   **Frontend Service:** Deploys the `client1` directory as a static site or another web service (depending on Render configuration within `render.yaml`).

## 📚 API Reference

The backend API is built with Node.js and Express. Key endpoints are inferred from the application's purpose.
